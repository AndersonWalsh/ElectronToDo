This is an implementation of a simple to-do application with the Electron JS framework.

The application can add, remove, and store locally to-do list items across multiple sessions.

The project features a Bootstrap UI and the electron-store API, in addition to the inter-process communication between main and renderer, and object-oriented extension of the Electron Store and BrowserWindow classes.

This is a work in progress with additional functionality planned. Implementation of item storage through MongoDB is the next task.
